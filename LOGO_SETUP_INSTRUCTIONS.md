# Logo Setup Instructions

I've created the LogoHeader component and integrated it into both the Home and Schedule pages. However, I need you to manually copy the logo PNG files to complete the setup.

## Steps to complete the logo setup:

1. **Save the three logo images** from the chat to your computer:
   - IEEE Gen logo (blue circular logo)
   - Elysian logo (golden text logo)  
   - IEEE Women in Engineering logo (purple circular logo)

2. **Copy the images** to the following locations with these exact names:
   - `public/logos/ieee-gen-logo.png` (IEEE Gen logo - left position)
   - `public/logos/elysian-logo.png` (Elysian logo - center position)
   - `public/logos/ieee-w-logo.png` (IEEE Women in Engineering logo - right position)

3. **Replace the placeholder files** I created in `public/logos/` with the actual PNG files.

## What I've already done:

✅ Created LogoHeader component with proper positioning
✅ Added the component to both Home and Schedule pages  
✅ Fixed z-index layering issues (LogoHeader above Navigation)
✅ Repositioned Navigation bar below the logos
✅ Added smart scroll-based visibility (only visible at top of page)
✅ Created shared scroll hook for coordinated header behavior
✅ Adjusted page padding to accommodate both headers
✅ Added white glow effects behind IEEE logos for better readability
✅ Added subtle golden glow for Elysian logo consistency
✅ Added hover effects and animations
✅ Made the header responsive and properly styled
✅ Created the logos directory structure
✅ Added fallback text display if images fail to load

## Features of the LogoHeader:

- **Smart scroll behavior**: Only visible when at the very top of the page (< 50px)
- **Clean scrolling experience**: Completely hidden when scrolled away from top
- **Coordinated navigation**: Navigation bar smoothly adjusts position when logos hide/show
- IEEE Gen logo on the left with white glow background for readability
- Elysian logo in the center (slightly larger) with subtle golden glow
- IEEE Women in Engineering logo on the right with white glow background
- Smooth animations on page load and scroll transitions
- Enhanced hover effects with scaling and intensified glow
- Responsive design
- Maintains website theme while ensuring logo readability
- Fallback text display if images aren't available yet

## Current Status:

✅ **FIXED**: The navigation bar covering issue has been resolved!

The LogoHeader is now properly positioned above the navigation bar and will show placeholder text ("IEEE GEN", "ELYSIAN", "IEEE WIE") until you replace the placeholder files with the actual PNG images. The logos are now fully visible and the navigation bar sits nicely below them.

## Testing:

You can run the development server to see the header in action:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The header will be visible at the top of both the Home and Schedule pages.
